Before you install the bot, there are a few things you need to have taken care off before you will be able to run the bot.

-   You need a separate [Unlimited](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663) Steam account with a mobile authenticator. I suggest using the [Steam Desktop Authenticator](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator) to authenticate the account and get the secret keys used to automate generating 2FA codes and managing mobile confirmations.
-   NodeJS version 8 or more
-   Typescript 3.7 or above

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot/wiki) for setting up the bot. For additional help and questions, please ask in the tf2autobot-IdiNium [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZrVT7mc) or create an [issue](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot/issues/new/choose).

## Difference between tf2autobot and tf2-automatic

The original tf2-automatic repository already have a lot of features, but some features in this version have their own advantages. Let me list out what features that worth mentioning, which already exist and what features that have been added into this version:

### Original tf2-automatic

-   free autoprice (use prices from [prices.tf](https://prices.tf/)) and unlimited listings (depends on your backpack.tf listings cap)
-   automatically craft/smelt pure metals (for currency changes)
-   offer review (on invalid value/item or overstocked or duped items)
-   dupe check on items that are more than minimum keys (you set it yourself)

### tf2autobot version

**Added an option to:**

-   use Discord Webhook for your bot to send accepted trade summary/ offer review/ messages.
-   disable show only metal in trade summary (it will show x keys, y ref, it will show only x ref on original version)
-   enable Autokeys (to keep your refined metal stock) and key banking ([jump](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot#autokeys-auto-buy-or-sell-keys-feature))
-   set your own custom greeting/success/failed messages and offer review notes
-   set all craft weapons as currency (0.05 ref) and automatically craft duplicate craftable weapons
-   send to the trade partner a summary of their offer if need to be reviewed ([jump](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot#offer-review-summary-on-trade-partner-side))
-   automatically accept trade with `INVALID_VALUE exception`.
-   automatically decline (skip manual review) **ONLY `INVALID_VALUE`** trade, if not within INVALID_VALUE exception sku and value range.
-   automatically accept (skip manual review) `INVALID_ITEMS` or `OVERSTOCKED` trades if the trade partner offer more than what they're taking (overpay).
-   make `INVALID_ITEMS` to be priced using price from Prices.TF.
-   NOT mention (Discord Webhook) on an `INVALID_VALUE` offer
-   check Dueling Mini-Game to only accept 5 Uses!
-   check Noise Maker to only accept 25 Uses!
-   disable acceptting friend request and inviting people to join groups.
-   alert admins when there's something wrong, like queue problem (which the original one is still not fixed yet, and I have no idea why) and when your bot is out of space or if your bot has less than minimum pure (must enable Autokeys feature)

**Others:**

-   automatically restart your bot on queue problem, and automatically relist if backpack.tf does not synchronized with your bot listings on Autokeys (sometimes it's set to automatically buy keys, but at backpack.tf, it's listed to sell.)
-   use emojis on almost all messages
-   list out every items on each offer review reasons
-   New added commands: "!pure", "!time", "!delete", "!check", "!block", "!unblock", "!autokeys", "!refreshautokeys", "!inventory", "!relist", "!pricecheckall", "!craftweapon" and "!uncraftweapon" commands
-   and more to come!

## Added features

### Discord Webhook feature

Instead of the bot sending trade summary, review offer and messages to you via Steam Chat, this version will let your bot to send it to a different channels in your discord server.
If you want to use Offer Review and Messages as Discord Webhook, you can not reply to the message sent by your Discord Webhook bot, unless you have [tf2-autocord](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2-autocord) installed.

Screenshots:

-   Trade summary (or live-trades) -

![trade-summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/84581315-9de69480-ae12-11ea-806f-2408bfb4b5b9.PNG)

-   Offer review (when trade partner sent wrong value/overstocked/etc) -

![Offer-review](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/85020166-80168800-b1a2-11ea-99f2-04766677fdf7.PNG)

-   Messages (when trade partner send "!message" command -

![Messages](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/84581313-9cb56780-ae12-11ea-9dcf-2d660d8ae184.PNG)

-   Price update (Discord Only) - Show price change for every items that are on your pricelist -

![price-update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/83712639-cc1ce500-a658-11ea-855d-5de43b39ff2f.png)

You can also only set it to send only trade summary, but the others like Offer review and Messages will be sent to you via Steam Chat.

Note that, it's an option to show key rate/ pure stock/ quick links on each feature.

If you want to use this feature, you must use [ecosystem.template.json](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot/blob/master/template.ecosystem.json) from this version, which contains much more variables for you to fill in.

### Autokeys (auto buy or sell keys) feature

This feature when enabled, your bot will automatically buy or sell keys based on your bot pure availability and your settings on this feature. You'll need to set your minimum/maximum keys and minimum/maximum refined metals in your ecosystem.json - more explaination can be found [here](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot#your-bot-settings) starting on `ENABLE_AUTO_SELL_AND_BUY_KEYS` until `MAXIMUM_REFINED_TO_STOP_SELL_KEYS`.

Some screenshots:

-   When your bot have enough key to sell to get more ref (if your ref is less than minimum) OR enough ref to buy more keys (when your ref > maximum and keys < max)

![autokeys1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/84581306-9a530d80-ae12-11ea-9bd5-3a988ac447d9.png)

-   When your bot don't have enough of what I've said before:

![autokeys3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/84581310-9c1cd100-ae12-11ea-80fa-085ad8bff73e.png)

You can see codes on how this feature works [here](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot/blob/master/src/classes/MyHandler.ts#L1636-L2304).

### Emojis and more commands added

![commands](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/87851703-f76c4280-c92d-11ea-8bd4-60a79312929f.png)

### Offer review summary on trade partner side

![review-note-trade-partner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/85020170-8147b500-b1a2-11ea-96b5-1805ad8cc31c.PNG)

### INVALID_VALUE exception

Let say you want to trade an unusual OR an australium, which the value as we know is huge (more than 5 keys), and then someone sent a trade offer with 0.11 ref less, your bot will skip this offer and send you notification to do review on this offer. With this exception, your bot will accept the trade as long as it's less than the exception value in ref that you've set. To use this feature, you'll need to set it on both `INVALID_VALUE_EXCEPTION_SKUS` and `INVALID_VALUE_EXCEPTION_VALUE_IN_REF`. See [here](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot#manual-review-settings).

![Invalid_value_exception1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/84966884-38adde80-b145-11ea-9aac-d28daf9a74e6.PNG)

![Invalid_value_exception2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/84966887-39df0b80-b145-11ea-9d81-021d302e7cf0.PNG)

## Variables in ecosystem.json summary

### Your bot credentials

-   `STEAM_ACCOUNT_NAME`: username that is used to login (preferably your bot/alt Steam account).
-   `STEAM_PASSWORD`: your bot Steam account password.
-   `STEAM_SHARED_SECRET`: you can found this in `<Your Bot SteamID64>.maFile` file inside ~/SDA/maFiles folder. Open the file using notepad and search for `"shared_secret": "agdgwegdgawfagxafagfkagusbuigiuefh=="` <-- take only this one (which is `agdgwegdgawfagxafagfkagusbuigiuefh==` in this example. Do not use this one).
-   `STEAM_IDENTITY_SECRET`: same as above (but now search for `identity_secret`).

### Prices.TF token

-   `PRICESTF_API_TOKEN`: You can leave this empty. No need at all.

### Backpack.tf token and API Key

You can run your bot without this first, which then on the first run, it will print out your bot backpack.tf access token and apiKey. You'll need to copy and paste it into your ecosystem.json or .env file, [see this image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/697415702637838366/697820077248086126/bptf-api-token.png), BUT if you want to find it yourself, then,

-   `BPTF_ACCESS_TOKEN`: https://backpack.tf/connections and click on `Show Token` under User Token.
-   `BPTF_API_KEY`: https://backpack.tf/developer/apikey/view - fill in site URL (`http://localhost:4566/tasks`) and comments (`Check if a user is banned on backpack.tf`).

### Your bot settings

-   `AUTOBUMP`: [true|false] Default is `true`. If you don't have backpack.tf premium, then your bot will re-list all listings every 30 minutes.

-   `MINIMUM_SCRAP`: [Number] Default is 9 scraps. If it has less, it will smelt reclaimed metal so your bot will have more than minimum scraps.
-   `MINIMUM_RECLAIMED`: [Number] Default is 9 Reclaimed. Explained above.

#### Autokeys feature

-   `ENABLE_AUTO_SELL_AND_BUY_KEYS`: [true|false] Default is `false`. If you set to `true`, the bot will automatically sell/buy keys based on the availability of the refined metals and keys in your bot inventory. Set it to false if you want to custom price your key.
-   `ENABLE_AUTO_KEY_BANKING`: [true|false] Default is `false`. If set to `true`, it will do key banking (must also set **ENABLE_AUTO_SELL_AND_BUY_KEYS** to `true` and for banking, meaning if current ref is in between min and max and keys > min, it will do key banking).
-   `MINIMUM_KEYS`: [Number] When current keys > minimum keys, it will start selling keys (with when current ref < minimum ref), else it will stop selling keys.
-   `MAXIMUM_KEYS`: [Number] When current keys < maximum keys, it will start buying keys (with when current ref > maximum ref), else it will stop buying keys.
-   `MINIMUM_REFINED_TO_START_SELL_KEYS`: [Number] - Already explained.
-   `MAXIMUM_REFINED_TO_STOP_SELL_KEYS`: [Number] - Already explained.
-   `DISABLE_SCRAP_ADJUSTMENT`: [true|false] Default is `true` (disabled). Set to `false` to make an adjustment on the key price (only when sell or buy, it is not possible while banking).
-   `SCRAP_ADJUSTMENT_VALUE`: [Integer] Default is `1` (1 scrap or 0.11 ref). Please only put an integer (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

\*\*This feature is meant to make your bot to have enough pure in their inventory. Enabling Autokeys - Banking might cause your bot to not function as intended.

#### Set to true if want to disable

-   `DISABLE_INVENTORY_SORT`: [true|false] Default: `false`. Sort your bot inventory.
-   `DISABLE_LISTINGS`: [true|false] Default: `false`. This is used if you want to temporarily disable trading while your bot is alive.
-   `DISABLE_CRAFTING_METAL`: [true|false] Default: `false`. **NOT RECOMMENDED** to set is as `true`, as it cause bot and trade partner to not be able to trade because of missing pure changes.
-   `DISABLE_CRAFTING_WEAPONS`: [true|false] Default: `false`. Set to **`true` if you DO NOT** want your bot to automatically craft any duplicated craftable weapons.
-   `DISABLE_MESSAGES`: [true|false] Default: `false`. When `true`, people (that are friend with your bot) will be unable send messages to you with "!message" command.
-   `DISABLE_SOMETHING_WRONG_ALERT`: [true|false] - Default: `false`. My custom - Used to notify owner if your bot has a queue problem/full inventory/low in pure (if Autokeys is on).
-   `DISABLE_CRAFTWEAPON_AS_CURRENCY`: [true|false] - Default: `false`. Set it as `true` if you don't want to set craft weapons as currency (0.05 ref).
-   `DISABLE_GIVE_PRICE_TO_INVALID_ITEMS`: [true|false] - Default: `false`. Set to `true` if you don't want `INVALID_ITEMS` (items that are not in your pricelist) to be priced using price from prices.TF.
-   `DISABLE_ADD_FRIENDS`: [true|false] - Default: `false`. Set to `true` if you don't want people to add your bot (not recommended).
-   `DISABLE_GROUPS_INVITE`: [true|false] - Default: `false`. Set to `true` if you don't want your bot to invite people to join groups **(You still need to have at least 1 group ID in the `GROUPS` array)**.
-   `DISABLE_CHECK_USES_DUELING_MINI_GAME`: [true|false] - Default: `false`. Set to `true` if you want your bot to buy Dueling Mini-Game of regardless of how many uses left.
-   `DISABLE_CHECK_USES_NOISE_MAKER`: [true|false] - Default: `false`. Set to `true` if you want your bot to accept Noise Maker that is not 25 Uses.

#### Set to true if want to enable

-   `NORMALIZE_FESTIVIZED_ITEMS`: [true|false] Default: `false`. Set to `true` if you want your bot to recognize `Festivized` item as a `Non-Festivized` item. For example you're listing to bank `Strange Australium Black Box`, but someone sent to your bot a Festivized version with the name `Festivized Strange Australium Black Box`, the bot by default will either decline or skip (if you enable manual review) the offer becuase it's not matched. Thus, set to `true` if you want your bot to recognize `Festivized Strange Australium Black Box` as `Strange Australium Black Box`.

#### Misc feature

-   `TRADES_MADE_STARTER_VALUE`: [Number] - Used mainly for displaying your bot total trades made, found in your bot Steam Profile page (leave it 0 if you don't care about it, used for discord webhook).
-   `LAST_TOTAL_TRADES`: [Number] - Used if your polldata.json is getting bigger which consumed a lot of RAM, but you want to keep total successful trades that your bot has made (leave it 0 if you don't care about it).
-   `TRADING_STARTING_TIME_UNIX`: [Number - Unix format] - Also same as LAST_TOTAL_TRADES, but this one is the latest time (leave it 0 if you don't care about it). You can read more on my [Discord server post](https://discordapp.com/channels/664971400678998016/666909518604533760/707706994932449410).

#### Duped unusual check feature

-   `ENABLE_SHOW_ONLY_METAL`: [true|false] - Default: `true`. My custom - If set to `false`, it will show [x keys, y ref].

-   `SKIP_ACCOUNT_LIMITATIONS`: [true|false] - Default: `false`. Used to check your account limitation. It's better to set to `true` if your bot Steam account already a [premium account](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663).
-   `SKIP_UPDATE_PROFILE_SETTINGS`: [true|false] - Default: `false`. This is just set your bot profile to public, so backpack.tf can load your bot inventory and etc correctly. If you already set all to public, just set this to `true`.

#### Set to true if want to allow

-   `ALLOW_ESCROW`: [true|false] - Default: `false`. Escrow = trade hold
