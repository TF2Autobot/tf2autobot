# Welcome to TF2Autobot
TF2Autobot was made possible by [tf2-automatic](https://github.com/Nicklason/tf2-automatic) and improved upon by [idiNium.](http://github.com/idinium96/) You can check out the differences [here.](https://github.com/TF2Autobot/tf2autobot/wiki/Differences-between-TF2Autobot-and-tf2-automatic)

If this is your first time around we strongly urge you to **read the whole wiki** before you decide to install anything.

## So, what's ahead of me?
This wiki will guide you from downloading the bot to having your bot automatically trade items with other users on backpack.tf.

It answers [common errors](https://github.com/TF2Autobot/tf2autobot/wiki/Common-Errors) and [questions](https://github.com/TF2Autobot/tf2autobot/wiki/FAQ) in our guides below.

## Feeling ready?
If so start by reading the [Before you start section.](https://github.com/TF2Autobot/tf2autobot/wiki/Before-you-start)
